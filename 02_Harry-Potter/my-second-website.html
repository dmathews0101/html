                    The series of 7 books follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. The events in the first book - Harry 
                    Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is as follows. Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house 
                    of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at 
                    the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites 
                    him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a baby, his parents 
                    were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse 
                    rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.

                    Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron 
                    Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or 
                    Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike 
                    for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the 
                    Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book 
                    concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain 
                    the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.

                    The Second book - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry's second year at Hogwarts. 
                    Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary 
                    targets. The attacks appear related to the Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school. 
                    Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and 
                    associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber's secrets 
                    and enter it. Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley, who 
                    was possessed by an old diary in her belongings. The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger 
                    self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk, an ancient monster that kills those who 
                    make direct eye contact. Harry draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the basilisk 
                    and destroys the diary.

                    In the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by 
                    Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents' murder. As Harry struggles with 
                    his reaction to the dementors – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he reaches out to 
                    Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a 
                    black dog into the Shrieking Shack; Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. 
                    Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black was James Potter's best friend; he was framed by Peter 
                    Pettigrew, who hides as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a 
                    werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after him but are surrounded by dementors. They are saved by 
                    a mysterious figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry, 
                    who traveled back in time with Hermione using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a 
                    Hippogriff.

                    In Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in the fourth book - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), 
                    he is unwillingly entered in the Triwizard Tournament, a contest between schools of witchcraft and 
                    wizardry. Harry is Hogwarts' second participant after Cedric Diggory, an unusual occurrence that 
                    causes his friends to distance themselves from him. He competes against schools Beauxbatons and 
                    Durmstrang with the help of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Alastor "Mad-Eye" 
                    Moody. Harry claims the Triwizard Cup with Cedric, but in doing so is teleported to a graveyard where 
                    Voldemort's supporters convene. Moody reveals himself be to Barty Crouch, Jr, a Death Eater. Harry 
                    manages to escape, but Cedric is killed and Voldemort is resurrected using Harry's blood.

                    In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe  
                    that Voldemort has returned. Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society to 
                    counter Voldemort; meanwhile, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. 
                    Umbridge bans the Defense Against the Dark Arts; in response, Hermione and Ron form "Dumbledore's Army", 
                    a secret group where Harry teaches what Umbridge forbids. Harry is punished for disobeying Umbridge, and 
                    dreams of a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic. Near the end of the book, Harry falsely dreams of 
                    Sirius being tortured; he races to the Ministry where he faces Death Eaters. The Order of the Phoenix 
                    saves the teenagers' lives, but Sirius is killed. A prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort is then 
                    revealed: one must die at the hands of the other.

                    In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Snape teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts 
                    while Horace Slughorn becomes the Potions master. Harry finds an old textbook with annotations by the 
                    Half-Blood Prince, due to which he achieves success in Potions class. Harry also takes lessons with 
                    Dumbledore, viewing memories about the early life of Voldemort in a device called a Pensieve. Harry learns 
                    from a drunken Slughorn that he used to teach Tom Riddle, and that Voldemort divided his soul into pieces, 
                    creating a series of Horcruxes. Harry and Dumbledore travel to a distant lake to destroy a Horcrux; they 
                    succeed, but Dumbledore weakens. On their return, they find Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters attacking the 
                    school. The book ends with the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.

                    In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh book in the series, Lord Voldemort gains control of 
                    the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione learn about the Deathly Hallows, legendary items that lead 
                    to mastery over death. The group infiltrate the ministry, where they steal a locket Horcrux, and visit 
                    Godric's Hollow, where they are attacked by Nagini. A silver doe Patronus leads them to the Sword of 
                    Gryffindor, with which they destroy the locket. They steal a Horcrux from Gringotts and travel to Hogwarts, 
                    culminating in a battle with Death Eaters. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia, but lends Harry 
                    his memories before he dies. Harry learns that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore, and that he himself 
                    is a Horcrux. Harry surrenders to Voldemort and dies. The defenders of Hogwarts continue to fight on; Harry 
                    is resurrected, faces Voldemort and kills him.

                    An epilogue titled "Nineteen Years Later" describes the lives of the surviving characters and the impact 
                    of Voldemort's death. Harry and Ginny are married with three children, and Ron and Hermione are married 
                    with two children.
