            <h1>01. Introduction about HTML</h1>
            <p>
                The full form of HTML is Hyper Text Markup language. It describes the structure of a web page. HTML is used to present web content in a structured and logical way.
                HTML does this by using Tags. Examples of HTML Tags are paragraph tags, Heading Tags, Anchor Tags, Image Tag, etc. We use tags to mark content up. Tags can contain 
                Attributes. Attributes are a way of telling more information about the tag. Different tags have different attributes, but there are a few global attributes, that
                every tag can have. Example of attributes are class, style, href etc. We can give multiple attributes to an element or a Tag. So attributes can be used within tags to
                give it more information. We can also nest tags. Example we can use an em tag inside a paragraph.
            </p>

            <h1>02. Structure / Syntax of an HTML Document</h1>
            <p>
                HTML uses Tags example <h1> heading content <h1/> to present content. There are many different Tags example p tag, h1 tag, a tag, em tag, strong tag, etc. Tags can contain attributes example 
                class, etc. 
                
                Syntax : <Tag-name Attribute-name = "Value of the Attribute"> Content </Tag-name>
                Example : <p class="myclass"> Paragraph Text Content </p>
                
                Tags can be nested in other Tags. Tags are normally indented when nested for readability.
            </p>

            <h1>03 VS Code / Atom / Brackets</h1>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support 
                for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

                Atom is a modern desktop text editor. It is a convenient to use and is flexible. Its goal is a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability. 
                Brackets is a modern open source text editor that makes it easy to design in the browser. It is designed from the ground up for web designers and front-end developers.

            <h1>04 Creating a HTML Website</h1>
            <p>
                Example website 01 : My First website, Dubai
                Example website 02 : My Second website, Harry Potter quick info page
                Example website 03 : My Third website, Types of Fish
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h1>05 HTML Tags</h1>
            <p>
                Head Tag - The head tag contains all the extra information, that we want to tell the browser, about a web page. Example Meta data, CSS and JavaScript references.
                Body Tag - The body tag contains all visual content, that we want to show to the user. Example Headings, Images, Paragraphs, etc.
                Example website 04 : My Fourth website, Types of Fish
                Other Tags - p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, small, mark, sub, sup, pre, etc
                Heading Tags - Structuring Headings - Heading tags range from h1 to h6.
                             - We give sections of a page an appropriate heading depending on its hierarchy in the document.
                             - Example website 05 : My Fifth Website, Types of Fish.
                Default Browser Styles - Browser is having this default CSS stylesheet, and all these default styles within this
                    stylesheet are the things thats giving the elements the different variations. Example variation of text in browser
                    for headings, paragraph, etc. The different font sizes, the different font weights, the spacing between the elements,
                    etc. So if there is no CSS, the user can still look at the webpage and it is very readable, and every browser has
                    its own kind of default styles. Example Google Chrome, firefox, internet explorer, etc have their own default styles,
                    however they are all pretty much the same.
                Image Tag - img - we specify where the image is stored using the src attribute
                          - <img src="image-source-path.jpg">
                          - Example : my-sixth-website.html, Types of Fish
                HTML Link Tag - <a href="link-source">Link Text</a>
                              - Internal - links to pages in own website
                              - External - Links to other websites
                              - Downloads - Links to Files
                              - Anchors - Link to specific areas on a page

                          themselves, have no visual impact on the web page, but when we combine these with CSS Rules,
                          ID's, thats when it is going to come into play.
